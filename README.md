# NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION IN VIETNAMESE TEXTS OF COVID-19 NEWS

In this paper, we present two methods to train Deep Learning models which are able to recognize entities in Vietnamese texts of Covid-19
news. The two models we use are Bidirectional Short Term Long Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Rated Memory (BiGRU). The F1 score 
for prediction on the test set is 66.7 % for BiLSTM and 66 % for BiGRU.

About project: Using BiLSTM, BiGRU and SimpleRNN model to named entity recognition in PhoNER_COVID19 dataset.
